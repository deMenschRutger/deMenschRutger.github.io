                Hi! My name is Rutger Mensch. I'm a freelance backend developer from
                The Netherlands who specializes in developing large-scale backends for
                websites and apps. After working as a backend developer for
                <a href="https://media.monks.com/">Media.Monks</a> for close to ten
                years, I started my adventure as a freelance developer in December 2022.
            </p>
            <h2>My skills</h2>
            <p>
                In my 10+ years of developing projects for the web I have worked on many
                different types of backends, including many REST APIs, CMSes, command
                line tools, integrations with third-party APIs and applications that
                ingest and expose large amounts of real-time data. I enjoy working on
                larger platforms, and I have significant experience working with large
                scalable systems, including microservice and serverless architectures,
                as well as traditional monoliths.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years I have mostly used Python and Node.js (with TypeScript)
                for my projects, often in combination with technologies such as
                PostgreSQL, Redis and Kafka. I consider my skills to be T-shaped:
                although backend development is my main expertise, I have significant
                experience with infrastructure (AWS) and frontend development as well.
                I'm a quick and independent learner, and like many developers I'm
                always excited about possibilities to learn new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my last four years at Media.Monks I was the lead backend
                developer on a large video platform for the Olympic Games. In this role
                I frequently connected with product owners and solution architects about
                the technical direction of the platform. I also spearheaded the backlog
                refinement sessions for a team of four to eight backend developers and
                did many code reviews to ensure the consistency of our code base. This
                experience allowed me to further develop my communication skills and my
                ability to lead a small to mid-sized development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                High quality software is reliable and predictable, and as such I have a
                firm belief in the importance of automated testing, documentation and
                the maintainability of code. Furthermore I believe that a strong sense
                of ownership is essential for any developer, since as developers our
                ultimate goal is to add value and solve problems for end users.
            </p>
